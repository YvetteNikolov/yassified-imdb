# ðŸ’• yassified ðŸ’• IMDb Chrome Extension

Despite what many comment sections on the internet would have you believe, the gender split of people who use the internet is 50/50. However, this is not the case with people who rate films on IMDb: most IMDb voters are male, which skews the rankings in favor of films that are aimed towards men.

This extension makes it possible to instantly see the rating split between male en female.

Work in progress.

## Background

A lot of (academic) articles have been written about these skewed ratings. A quick Google search gives these articles:

- ['Rotten Tomato and IMDb: film rankings skewed by mostly male voters'](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rotten-tomato-and-imdb-film-rankings-skewed-by-mostly-male-voters-zznpfv20z)
- ['IMDb analysed: how do men and women's favourite films differ?'](https://oneroomwithaview.com/2016/08/10/imdb-analysed-men-womens-favourite-films-differ/)
- [â€˜Review bombingâ€™ of shows and movies like â€˜She-Hulkâ€™ and â€˜Turning Redâ€™ is ruining the credibility of online ratings](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/review-bombing-of-shows-and-movies-like-she-hulk-and-turning-red-is-ruining-the-credibility-of-online-ratings/article65825293.ece)
