# ðŸ’• yassified ðŸ’• IMDb Chrome Extension

Despite what many comment sections on the internet would have you believe, the gender split of people who use the internet is 50/50. However, this is not the case with people who rate films on IMDb: most IMDb voters are male, which skews the rankings in favor of films that are aimed towards men.

This extension removes the men from the rating equation, showing a feminized IMDb rating.

Work in progress.
