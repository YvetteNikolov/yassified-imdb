## Background

Despite what many comment sections on the internet would have you believe, the gender split of people who use the internet is 50/50. However, this is not the case with people who rate films on IMDb. Most IMDb voters are male, which skews the rankings in favor of films that are aimed towards men.

A lot of (academic) articles have been written about skewed film ratings. A quick Google search:
